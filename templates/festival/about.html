        <h2>Milestone</h2> 
        <p>
            ShareFestival was launched in 2022 by 5 masters students from the University of Glasgow. Building on an existing design activity, 
            their concept was to create a website to promote the each country's creativity and tradition through their festivals. Not knowing the 
            countries festivals after relocating was their inspiration to start the website. Thus, they focused on becoming an aid for people like 
            them, to be a educator for people and more over a place to share their experience.
